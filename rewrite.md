# Web Site Rewrite Project

We're kicking this off at the end of May, beginning of June. We'll assign each page to its appropriate group/person and Rich will update the site pages with the contributed content.

2020-05-27T11-04:00 - Sent e-mail to Jo for assignment suggestions. Sent my list.

## Gantt Charts (most recent first)
- The bottom horizontal axis is a date labeled timeline.
- Dark gray tasks are done.
- Light gray tasks with a blue border are in progress.
- Dark blue tasks are to be done after tasks in progress
- Red tasks are critical.
- My comments and questions precede each graphic.


### May 28, 2020-05-28T18

I'm still not clear who has been assigned the following pages:
- Tikkun Olam
- Mitzvot
- Social Action
- Other Clubs
- Facilities Rental
- Mitzvah Gallery

We have to fix the menu order for these:
- Tikkun Olam
- Social Action


We have to assign writers and find menu spots for these new pages:
- Facilities Rental
- Mitzvah Gallery



With a rewrite window of two weeks we are looking at a completion date of June 17, 2020.
