# Web Site Rewrite Project

We're kicking this off at the end of May, beginning of June. We'll assign each page to its appropriate group/person and Rich will update the site pages with the contributed content.

- The bottom horizontal axis is a date labeled timeline.
- Dark gray tasks are done.

- Dark blue tasks are to be done after tasks in progress
